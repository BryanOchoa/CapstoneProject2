# Capstone Project 2 : Personal Portfolio Website

## Introduction  
This project is the second capstone assignment in the Full Stack Development course I am taking on Udemy.  
The objective is to create a personal portfolio website that showcases my skills, experiences, and interests.  
This project will be built entirely with HTML and CSS, without JavaScript, focusing on design principles and usability.  

A key aspect of this project is practicing version control. I am committing all my changes to GitHub to document my progress and refine my workflow for future development projects. This demonstrates my attention to detail and commitment to industry best practices.

## Project Goals  
The primary goals for this project are:  
- Design and develop a visually appealing and easy-to-navigate personal portfolio website.  
- Showcase my skills, experiences, and interests.  
- Build the website using only HTML and CSS (no JavaScript).  
- Ensure the site is responsive, accessible, and user-friendly.  

## Development Process  
To achieve the project goals, I followed a structured process:  

1. **Design Mockup**: Created a visual prototype of the website using Canva. [View the mockup here](#) (insert link when ready).  
2. **Initial Setup**:  
   - Created a basic HTML boilerplate.  
   - Initialized a Git repository and pushed the initial setup to GitHub.  
3. **Section-by-Section Implementation**:  
   - **Title Section**: Designed the website's header and logo (commit and push).  
   - **Introduction Section**: Added an "About Me" section to introduce myself (commit and push).  
   - **Skills Section**: Highlighted my technical skills and tools I'm proficient in (commit and push).  
   - **Contact Section**: Developed a section with my contact details and a contact form (commit and push).  
   - **Footer**: Added a footer with navigation links and copyright information (commit and push).  
4. **Final Polish**:  
   - Reviewed the code for semantic structure and accessibility.  
   - Ensured the design matches the mockup and functions as intended.  

## Technologies Used  
- HTML5  
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- Git & GitHub  
- Canva (for mockup design)  

## Future Enhancements  
- Add interactivity using JavaScript (e.g., animations, dynamic elements).  
- Implement a blog section to share thoughts and tutorials.  
- Enhance the design with CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind.
